Hi, I'm @cellio, community lead and issue-wrangler for [Codidact](https://github.com/codidact/qpixel),
a platform for community knowledge-sharing (Q&A and more).  We're a very small team and we welcome more contributors!
Primary technologies: Ruby on Rails, Javascript, HTML/SCSS.

I also use a private repo here to manage my [personal web site](https://cellio.org/).

Ways to reach me: <a rel="me" href="https://indieweb.social/@cellio">Fediverse (Mastodon)</a>,
Discord (cellio#8077), email (github user name at pobox dot com).
